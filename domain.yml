  utter_abstraction:
  - text: Data abstraction is a technique used in computer programming to separate
      the implementation details of a data type from its interface, allowing the implementation
      to be changed without affecting the code that uses it. This is often achieved
      through the use of abstract data types (ADTs), which are defined by the operations
      they support rather than their specific implementation, or through the use of
      interfaces and classes in object-oriented programming languages. Data abstraction
      helps to reduce the complexity of software systems by allowing code to be written
      in a modular and flexible way and by hiding the underlying details of data types
      from the user.
  utter_accumulator_based:
  - text: Accumulator-based architecture is a type of computer architecture where
      the CPU has a dedicated register called an accumulator that is used to store
      intermediate results during computation. The accumulator serves as a temporary
      storage location for arithmetic and logical operations, and the results are
      stored back in the accumulator. Accumulator-based architecture is simple and
      commonly used in early computer systems and microcontrollers.
  utter_adders:
  - text: Adders are digital circuits used in computer hardware to perform addition
      of binary numbers. They can add two or more binary numbers and produce a sum
      output. Adders can be implemented using various techniques, such as half-adders,
      full-adders, ripple carry adders, carry-lookahead adders, and carry-skip adders.
      Adders are fundamental components used in arithmetic and logical operations
      in computer systems.
  utter_aggregation:
  - text: Aggregation is a relationship between objects in object-oriented programming
      (OOP) where one object contains or is composed of other objects, but the contained
      objects can exist independently of the containing object. Aggregation is a form
      of association, where objects are connected in a whole-part relationship. Aggregation
      allows for creating complex objects by combining simpler objects, and it promotes
      code reuse and modularity. Aggregation is commonly used for modeling relationships
      such as has-a or part-of between objects.
  utter_ai:
  - text: Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, refers to artificial
      intelligence systems that have the ability to perform any intellectual task
      that a human can. In other words, strong AI systems have a general and flexible
      intelligence that allows them to adapt to and learn new tasks, rather than being
      specifically designed for a single task or set of tasks. Weak AI, also known
      as artificial narrow intelligence, refers to artificial intelligence systems
      that are designed for a specific task or set of tasks. These systems are not
      capable of adapting to new tasks or learning new skills. They are often designed
      to perform a specific function, such as recognizing faces in images or playing
      a game like chess. In summary, the main difference between strong AI and weak
      AI is the scope and flexibility of their intelligence. Strong AI systems are
      capable of adapting to and learning new tasks, while weak AI systems are limited
      to the specific tasks they were designed for.
  utter_amdahls_law:
  - text: Amdahl's Law is a formula used to estimate the potential speedup of a computer
      system by optimizing a portion of the system, while keeping the rest unchanged.
      It states that the overall speedup is limited by the fraction of the system
      that is optimized. Amdahl's Law is commonly used to understand the trade-offs
      and limitations of performance improvements in parallel computing systems.
  utter_api:
  - text: 'An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols
      that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with
      each other. It defines the methods, data formats, and conventions that developers
      can use to build software applications that can integrate with other applications
      or services. There are several types of APIs, including: 1) Web APIs, which
      allow communication between web-based applications and services; 2) Operating
      system APIs, which provide access to system-level functionality, such as file
      system operations or device drivers; 3) Library APIs, which are collections
      of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks, such as
      database operations or image processing; and 4) Hardware APIs, which enable
      software applications to interact with hardware devices, such as sensors or
      printers.'
  utter_arbitration_schemes:
  - text: Arbitration schemes are used to manage access to shared resources, such
      as buses or memory, in a computer system. They determine how requests for access
      to shared resources are prioritized and granted. Common arbitration schemes
      include priority-based, round-robin, and token-based schemes. Arbitration schemes
      are crucial for managing concurrent access to shared resources and ensuring
      fair and efficient resource allocation.
  utter_asymptotic_notations:
  - text: Asymptotic notations describe the upper and/or lower bounds on algorithm
      complexity. Common notations include Big O, Omega, and Theta notation. Big O
      describes the upper bound on worst-case time complexity, Omega describes the
      lower bound on best-case time complexity, and Theta describes both upper and
      lower bounds. They are used to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency.
  utter_asynchronous_counters:
  - text: Asynchronous counters, also known as ripple counters, are digital circuits
      used in computer hardware for counting events or generating timing signals.
      They are commonly used for counting and timing applications where the output
      changes asynchronously with respect to the clock signal. Asynchronous counters
      can be implemented using various techniques, such as binary counters, decade
      counters, and up/down counters. They are widely used in computer systems for
      counting events, generating timing signals, and controlling system operations.
  utter_backpropagation_algorithm:
  - text: The Backpropagation Algorithm is a widely used optimization algorithm for
      training artificial neural networks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that
      uses a gradient-based approach to update the model weights based on the error
      between the predicted output and the actual output. Backpropagation calculates
      the gradient of the error with respect to the model weights and uses it to adjust
      the weights iteratively during the training process.
  utter_basic_io_interface:
  - text: Basic I/O Interface refers to the circuitry and protocols used to facilitate
      input and output (I/O) operations between a microprocessor or microcontroller

      typically include I/O ports, registers, and control logic that enable the microprocessor
      to send and receive data to and from external devices.
  utter_bcnf:
  - text: BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is a normal form in database design that is
      used to ensure that a database is free of certain types of anomalies and dependency
      issues. It requires that every determinant in the database be a candidate key,
      which is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each row in a table. BCNF
      is more restrictive than 3NF (Third Normal Form), which only requires that the
      database be in 2NF (Second Normal Form) and that all the non-key attributes
      in the database be fully dependent on the primary key. BCNF can result in a
      more complex database structure, with more tables and foreign keys, but it can
      help to ensure that the database is well-organized and easy to maintain and
      modify.
  utter_bias:
  - text: Bias in data science refers to the systematic error or deviation of a model
      or algorithm from the true underlying relationship it is attempting to model.
      Bias can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a poorly chosen model, incomplete
      or unrepresentative data, or incorrect assumptions about the data. Bias can
      have negative consequences, such as leading to inaccurate or unfair predictions
      or decisions. For example, a biased model might consistently overestimate or
      underestimate the value of a certain variable, or it might unfairly favor certain
      groups over others. It is important to identify and address bias in data science
      to ensure that models and algorithms are accurate and fair. This can be done
      through careful data selection and preprocessing, model selection and evaluation,
      and ongoing monitoring and testing.
  utter_bias_variance_tradeoff:
  - text: Bias-Variance Tradeoff is a concept in machine learning that represents
      the balance between a model's bias and variance. Bias refers to the error introduced
      by approximating real-world data with a simplified model, while variance represents
      the sensitivity of the model to variations in the training data. Finding the
      right balance between bias and variance is crucial for building a well-performing
      model.

      in transactions.
  utter_bn:
  - text: Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model that represent
      the dependencies between different variables. They are used to represent and
      reason about uncertain or probabilistic information. Bayesian networks consist
      of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which the nodes represent variables and
      the edges represent the dependencies between the variables. The variables can
      be binary (e.g., true/false) or continuous (e.g., real numbers). Each variable
      is associated with a probability distribution that describes its possible values
      and the likelihood of each value occurring. The edges in the graph represent
      the relationships between the variables, and the probabilities in the distributions
      are used to capture the dependencies between the variables. Bayesian networks
      are useful for representing complex systems with many variables and dependencies,
      and can be used to make predictions about the values of variables given the
      values of other variables. They are commonly used in fields such as machine
      learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.
  utter_branch_prediction:
  - text: Branch prediction is a technique used in modern processors to optimize instruction
      execution in the presence of conditional branches. Branches are instructions
      that can change the flow of program execution, and predicting the outcome of
      a branch before it is actually resolved can improve instruction fetch and execution
      efficiency. Techniques such as static branch prediction (based on instruction
      statistics), dynamic branch prediction (based on past execution behavior), and
      tournament branch prediction (combining multiple prediction techniques) are
      commonly used to reduce the performance impact of branches in pipelined processors.
  utter_bst:
  - text: A binary search tree (BST) is a tree-based data structure in which each
      node has at most two children and all the nodes in the left subtree of a node
      have a value less than the node's value, and all the nodes in the right subtree
      have a value greater than the node's value. This structure allows for fast searching,
      insertion, and deletion of elements. Binary search trees are often used to store
      data that needs to be retrieved quickly, such as in the implementation of a
      dictionary or set data type. They are also used in many other applications,
      such as for storing and organizing data in databases and for optimizing search
      algorithms.
  utter_bus_buffering:

      to reduce the CPU's access time to main memory, thereby improving system performance.
      Cache memory is an important component of the memory hierarchy and is typically
      organized into multiple levels, such as L1, L2, and L3 caches.
  utter_cap_theorem:
  - text: CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer's Theorem, states that in a distributed
      database system, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability,
      and partition tolerance. According to CAP Theorem, in the event of a network
      partition, a distributed database system must choose between maintaining consistency
      (all nodes have the same data), availability (all requests receive a response),
      or partition tolerance (system continues to operate despite network failures).
      This theorem has important implications for the design and trade-offs in distributed
      databases.

      more specialized tables, and establishing relationships between them using foreign
      keys. The goal of normalization is to reduce data redundancy, improve data integrity,
      and make it easier to modify the database structure. De-normalization is the
      process of reversing normalization, by combining tables or adding redundant
      data back into the database. It is often done to improve the performance of
      certain types of queries, at the expense of increased redundancy and a more
      complex database structure. De-normalization is used in cases where the benefits
      of faster query performance outweigh the drawbacks of increased data redundancy
      and complexity. Both normalization and de-normalization are important concepts
      in database design, and the appropriate approach depends on the specific requirements
      and goals of the database.

      of an array in a particular order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble
      sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Bubble sort
      compares adjacent elements in the array and swaps them if they are in the wrong
      order, repeatedly iterating through the array until it is sorted. Selection
      sort involves selecting the smallest or largest element in the unsorted portion
      of the array and moving it to its correct position. Insertion sort works by
      repeatedly inserting the next unsorted element into its correct position among
      the already sorted elements. Merge sort and quick sort are more efficient algorithms
      that use divide-and-conquer techniques to sort the array.
  utter_sparse_matrices:

  utter_supervised:
  - text: Supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning are two categories
      of machine learning algorithms that are used to train models on data. In supervised
      machine learning, the training data includes both input features and labeled
      output values. The goal of supervised learning is to train a model to make predictions
      about the output values given the input features. This requires the availability
      of labeled data, which can be used to train the model and evaluate its performance.
      Examples of supervised learning tasks include classification, regression, and
      prediction. In unsupervised machine learning, the training data includes only
      input features and no labeled output values. The goal of unsupervised learning
      is to find patterns and relationships in the data, rather than making predictions
      about specific output values. This requires the model to learn from the data
      itself, without the guidance of labeled outputs. Examples of unsupervised learning
      tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction. In summary, the main
      difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is the availability
      of labeled data. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised
      learning does not.

      is a widely used protocol suite for computer networks and the Internet. It defines
      a set of communication protocols that enable data transmission over networks.
      The TCP/IP reference model is based on a four-layered architecture that includes
      the Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access layers. It is the foundation
      of modern networking and is used for communication between devices connected
      to the Internet.
  utter_testing:
  - text: Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system or its component(s)
      with the intent of finding whether it satisfies the specified requirements or
      not. Software testing can be done manually or with the use of automated tools.
      It helps to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in the software.
      There are various types of software testing, including unit testing, integration
      testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, each of which has a specific
      focus and purpose. Software testing is an important part of the software development
      process because it helps to ensure that the software is of high quality and
      fit for its intended purpose.
  utter_theory_of_generalization:
  - text: The Theory of Generalization in machine learning studies how well a model
      can perform on unseen data after being trained on a limited dataset. It involves
      understanding the tradeoff between model complexity and performance, as well
      as the factors that affect a model's ability to generalize well to new data.
  utter_threads:
  - text: Threads are lightweight, independent sequences of instructions within a
      process that can be executed concurrently by a single CPU. Threads share the
      same memory space and file descriptors with their parent process, allowing for
      efficient communication and coordination. Threads can be used to achieve parallelism
      and improve performance in multi-core processors. There are various types of
      threads, such as user-level threads and kernel-level threads, with different
      levels of thread management and support from the operating system.
  utter_time-space_trade_offs:
  - text: Time-space trade offs refer to the trade-off between the amount of time
      (or computational resources) an algorithm takes and the amount of memory (or
      space) it uses. In some cases, an algorithm may use more memory to reduce its
      running time, or vice versa. Finding the right balance between time and space
      usage is an important consideration in algorithm design and optimization.
  utter_training_vs_testing:
  - text: Training is the phase in machine learning where a model is trained on a
      labeled dataset to learn patterns and relationships from the data. Testing,
      on the other hand, is the phase where the trained model is evaluated on a separate,
      unseen dataset to measure its performance and generalization ability.
  utter_truth_tables:
  - text: Truth tables are tables used in propositional logic to represent and analyze
      the truth values of logical propositions or statements. A truth table lists
      all possible combinations of truth values for the propositions in a logical
      expression and shows the resulting truth value of the expression for each combination.
      Truth tables are used to evaluate the validity, consistency, and satisfiability
      of logical expressions, and to determine the truth values of complex propositions
      based on the truth values of their constituent propositions. Truth tables are
      an important tool in formal logic for reasoning about the truthfulness of logical
      statements.
  utter_universal_quantification:
  - text: Universal quantification is a concept in predicate logic that quantifies
      over all elements in a domain or set. It is denoted by the symbol ∀ (for all)
      and is used to express statements that are true for every member of a domain.
      For example, the statement ∀x P(x) means that the predicate P holds for all
      elements x in the domain. Universal quantification allows for generalization
      and abstraction in logic, allowing us to make statements that hold universally
      for all instances.
  utter_vc_dimension:
  - text: VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) Dimension is a measure of the capacity or complexity
      of a machine learning model. It represents the maximum number of points that
      a model can shatter or perfectly fit in a binary classification problem. VC
      Dimension is used to analyze the generalization ability and complexity of a
      model.
  utter_virtual_network_functions:
  - text: Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are software-based network functions that
      can be run on virtualized infrastructure, such as virtual machines or containers.
      VNFs replace traditional network appliances, such as routers, switches, and
      firewalls, with software-based counterparts that can be deployed, scaled, and
      managed dynamically. VNFs offer flexibility, agility, and cost savings in network
      management, allowing network operators to virtualize and automate network functions.
  utter_virtual_reality:
  - text: Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional
      environment that can be interacted with using specialized hardware, such as
      headsets or controllers. It creates an immersive experience that can simulate
      real-world or imaginary environments. Applications of virtual reality include
      gaming, training simulations, therapy, architecture, and entertainment.
  utter_word_processing:
  - text: Word processing refers to the creation, editing, and formatting of documents
      containing text. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs,
      or LibreOffice Writer, provides tools and features for creating and editing
      documents with various formatting options, such as fonts, styles, headers, footers,
      and more.
